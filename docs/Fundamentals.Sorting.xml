            <summary>
            Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple
            sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares
            adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
            The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
            The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way
            smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

            <summary>
            Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final
            sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient
            on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort,
            heapsort, or merge sort.

        <member name="T:Fundamentals.Sorting.MergeSort">
            <summary>
            In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is
            an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm.
            Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order
            of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is
            a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann
            in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort
            appeared in a report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.

            <summary>
            Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has
            an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists,
            and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
